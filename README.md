# Statistical Power Simulation in R

This project contains simulations and visualizations for understanding the statistical power of t-tests under various conditions.

## About

This repository explores the concept of **statistical test power** using Monte Carlo simulations in R.  
You will find scripts that examine how power varies with:

- The true mean difference (`mu`)
- The significance level (`alpha`)
- Sample size (`n`)
- Distribution shape (normal, uniform, bimodal, t-Student)

The goal is to provide clear, reproducible examples and visual insights into how these factors influence the ability of the t-test to correctly reject a false null hypothesis.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` – R scripts with the core simulations and plots (`.R` files)
- `report.Rmd` – R Markdown file with a detailed report and narrative (optional)
- `assets/` – generated plots and related media (optional)
- `README.md` – this file
